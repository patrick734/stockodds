Next:
  1. git add -A && git commit -m "Mainnet deployment" && git push      (Vercel publishes the live site)
  2. ./verify.sh                                                        (post the output: proof the deployer holds nothing)
  3. Keep ETH in the dev wallet: it launches $ODDS on Pons next.
  4. Launch $ODDS on Pons, then: ./set-token.sh <token address>   (48h timelock, then buy-and-burn starts)
  5. Keeper NOW, before anyone plays: GitHub > Actions > "Keeper" > Run workflow (dry run), then set KEEPER_LIVE=1.
     It settles each round within minutes of the hour; an unsettled round turns void (full refunds) after about an hour.
  6. Vercel: import the repo, Root Directory "app", then add your domain (stockodds.fun).
